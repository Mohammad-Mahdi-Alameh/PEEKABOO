> The PEEKABOO app is live-tracking app , that notifies the users before they reach any infrastructural problem in seven seconds. The PEEKABOO app is more than just another tracking app; it enhances and fulfills the driving experience you are looking for.
> 


### User Stories
- As a user, I want to know of the presence of infrastructural problem before I reach it.
- As a user, I want to report the presence of any infrastructural problem I face, or already faced.(even If I wasn't moving)
- As a user, I want to report if this infrastructural problem is false.
- As a user, I want to see the status of my request regarding false infrastructural problem (pending , rejected, accepted).
- As a user, I want to see all infrastructural problems reported by me.

<br><br>
### Admin Stories
- As a admin, I want to manage all the users and see their report history.
- As a admin, I want to report the presence of any infrastructural problem whenever I want.
- As a admin, I want to delete (fix) any infrastructural problem immedietly.
- As a admin, I want to accept, and reject any user request regarding false infrastructural problem.

Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
